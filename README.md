# Retina Damage Detector from OCT Image

### Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

### The CNN model is trained with 84,495 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 4 categories (NORMAL, CNV, DME, DRUSEN). Also, Image augmentation is used to increase the performance of the model. The accuracy of the model is 93%.
